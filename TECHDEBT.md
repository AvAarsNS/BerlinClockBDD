- Give all magic numbers a name 🍅
- Turning the lights on based on number of on/off lights can be refactored to a seperate function
- Extract out the O/Y/R strings to constants so they can be named
- colourOfLightOnInThirdRow can be made more readable
- turnOnLightsInThirdRow can be made more readable, maybe with the separate function for turning on the lights
